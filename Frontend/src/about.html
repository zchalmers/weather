        <h4 style="text-align: left">What We Do</h4>At Trading Visualised, we are changing the way that you view your current investments. Instead of the boring tables for your portfolio, we have turned a non-visual tool into a visual and interactive one! With a fish tank that represents your whole portfolio and individual fish that represent the stocks that you own, looking at your portfolio has become that much less stressful.</div>
      <div class="jiffyfront"></div> <!--change this to a visual of the actual fish bowl-->
      <div class="text">
        <h4 style="text-align: left">How It Started</h4>After becoming overwhelmed and bored every time that we would look at our portfolio, we decided that there has to be a better way. With our unique take on portraying how your portfolio looks and your interaction with it, you may never get bored looking at stocks again.

      <div class="text">
        <h4 style="text-align: left">How does it Work?</h4> After you look up the stocks you want to buy and add them to your portfolio, there is a unique "visualize" button that will take you to our unique fish application where your stocks will turn into fish in an aquarium! From here you will be able to see the total value of your portfolio or aquarium at this point and be able to interact with each unique fish which represent your currently held stocks. You will be able to sell an individual fish with a click of a button that will update your stock portfolio. Also, if you would like to sell a batch of fish there is a "grenade" option (kid-friendly) that will sell multiple fish at a time. If you would like to liquidate one fish and put all of that money into another fish, there is also a "Eat Fish" option that will have a fish eat another fish.

        <h4 style="text-align: left">The future of Trading Visualized</h4>The value of looking at stocks in a different way is only the beginning! Our company already has some sights set on future projects for visualizing data in a more easy-to-understand, creative and different ways. We are treading a path that has never been walked by any other company, and the growth outlook for this innovation should be more than gravitational. We are all eyes forward with bringing our customers the best and latest technologies to their fingertips all at the click of a button.
