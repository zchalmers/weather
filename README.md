# Weather Notification Application
  A simple Springboot application that uses the OpenWeatherApi to get weather forecasts for the day. Will retrieve the weather forecast for the day, 
  write that information onto a stock photo and then utilize email to text to send an MMS message to the phone number provided. Made so that no fees 
  are required other than hosting the springboot application. There is also a Twilio implementation using their free trial that leaves a special text at
  the top of the text message that I did not like.
